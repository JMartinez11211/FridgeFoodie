Mod 1 end project. Food recipe website

[FridgeFoodie](https://jmartinez11211.github.io/FridgeFoodie/index.html) uses Tasty's food recipe API to fetch recipes users input.

I pull out information using 

- recipe thumbnail
- recipe title
- recipe description
- recipe video link

This website should help people fetch recipes, put them in a neat card and provied a link for video instruction for said recipe.
